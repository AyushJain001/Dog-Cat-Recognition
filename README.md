**Convolutional Neural Network**

A Convolutional Neural Network ( ConvNet /CNN) is a **Deep Learning** algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. 

The architecture of CNN is similar to what our brain functionality happens .
A convolutional neural network is used to detect and classify objects in an image.

A ConvNet is able to successfully capture the Spatial and Temporal dependencies in an image through the application of relevant filters. The architecture performs a better fitting to the image dataset due to the reduction in the number of parameters involved and reusability of weights.

The role of the ConvNet is to reduce the images into a form which is easier to process, without losing features which are critical for getting a good prediction. This is important when we are to design an architecture which is not only good at learning features but also is scalable to massive datasets.
